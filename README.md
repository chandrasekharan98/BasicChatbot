# BasicChatbot
A basic implementation of a Chatbot as an Android app which uses Google's DialogFlow API for its responses.  
 
Upon receiving the message from the user, it collects and displays the response via a HTTP request to the DialogFlow API.  
 
This Chatbot uses the pre-trained Jokes agent of DialogFlow, however based on the purpose a different agent can be trained.  

## Preview
It uses a recycler view to display and align the messages as shown below.
